# Artificial Intelligence: Problem-to-Graph search
Given A problem, implements Searchable, problem would be reduced to search in graph built on the fly, using Search Algorithm interface. Search can be uninformed or informed, And varoius algorithms implemented.
All Algorithms including A*, implemented generically for each searchable, while A* also uses an injected heuristic function.
Also includes an implementation of fully working usage for X Puzzle game, implements searchable with a proof for the heuristic function correctness (HE).
For the puprpose of uniformity in university exercise when grading, no duplicate prunning was done - can be added very easily.
