# Artificial Intelligence Problem-to-Graph search
Given A problem, using implements Searchable, it would be reduced to search in graphs built on the fly using Search Algorithm interface. Search can be uninformed or informed.
All Algorithms including A*, implemented generically for each searchable, while A* also uses an injected heuristic function.
Also includes an implementation of fully working usage for X Puzzle game, implements searchable.
